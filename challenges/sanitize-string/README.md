Given a string of random characters, including numbers, write a function that will accept that input and add up all of the numbers in the string.

Requirements:\

[x] Must have setting to use "-" to reduce value instead of add (true/false)\
[x] Must have setting to use "." to allow for decimal value instead of whole value (true/false)\
