# Pasal's Triangle

Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of numbers in which those at the ends of the rows are 1 and each of the others is the sum of the nearest two numbers in the row above (the apex, 1, being at the top).
eg.\
     1\
   1  1\
  1  2  1\
 1  3  3  1

 Challenge:
 Write a function that will output Pascal's triangle up to a given sequence number (in the above example, the input would be 4).
