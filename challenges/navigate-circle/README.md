    <summary>What is recursion?</summary><p>
At it's most basic, recursion is stateless, meaning that it is ONLY aware of what it's working on by what values it receives ... and the values it receives are sent FROM itself in the last iteration, ergo a recursive function is receiving values from it's last iteration and sending new values to the new iteration (OR exiting if the process is complete).
